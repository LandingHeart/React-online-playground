Welcome to the React Playground, a web-based code editor that provides a development experience similar to Visual Studio Code, right in your browser. It's designed for quickly prototyping, experimenting with, and sharing React components without the need for a local development setup.

## ‚ú® Features

- **VS Code Inspired UI**: A familiar and intuitive interface, including an activity bar, sidebars, and a tabbed editor.
- **File Explorer**: Navigate through your project's file and folder structure with ease.
- **Live Preview**: See your changes render in real-time in a dedicated preview pane.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/react-playground.git](https://github.com/your-username/react-playground.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd react-playground
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
5.  source venv/bin/activate to install python packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
6.  alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create initial tables"
    alembic revision -m "seed table"

## üîÆ Future Improvements

We have plans to add more features to make this playground even more powerful:

- [ ] Continue adding Integration with a real WebContainer API for in-browser code execution.
- [ ] Resizable panes for a more flexible layout. (currently buggy, fixing later)
- [ ] Support for adding and removing files/folders.
- [ ] Terminal integration.
- [ ] More themes for the editor.
- [ ] Auth, google auth, etc.
- [ ] project base questions, feature implementatins, fixing bug in provided code.
- [ ] docker container for fast api and next js.
